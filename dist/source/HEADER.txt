NOTICE: Any number after a "b" like jdom-1.1-b2 is a beta number.  Higher
numbers are later.  Any -rc1 or -rc2 stands for "release candidate" meaning
the release is being tested before official release.

The "contrib" package contains user-contributed software.  The "test"
package contains unit tests.  These are for more advanced users.
