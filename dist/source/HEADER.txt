NOTICE: The number after the "b" is the beta number.  Higher numbers are
later.  Any -rc1 or -rc2 stands for "release candidate" meaning the beta
is being tested before official release as beta.

The "contrib" package contains user-contributed software.  The "test"
package contains unit tests.  These are for more advanced users.
